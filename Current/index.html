            <p>Dear Friend,</p>
            <p>I’m looking for a “dream” client that I can bring in massive windfalls for.</p>
            <p>If you’re that client, I will personally work with you one-on-one in your business to help you double, triple, or maybe even quadruple your revenue for the next 12 months.</p>
            <p>You Pay Nothing Out of Pocket, Ever.</p>
            <p>Here’s why.</p>
            <p>The first thing I’m going to do for you is to personally help you create a strategic plan to bring in immediate mone</p>
            <p>There’s no charge for this and it only takes about 45-90 minutes for us to do together.</p>
            <p>Anyway, I’ll even do most of the heavily lifting for you… showing you exactly what to send, how to position your email, and how to bring in back-end money as well.</p>
            <p>At the end of this initial planning session one of these three things will happen:</p>
            <p>You love the plan and decide to implement it on your own. If this is the case, I’ll wish you the best of luck and ask that you keep in touch with me to let me know you’re doing.</p>
            <p>You love the plan and ask to become my client so I can personally help you execute, maximize, and profit from it ASAP</p>
            <p>If that’s the case, we’ll knock it out of the park … And that’s a promise. Every single one of my clients gets results. Literally Every. Single. One.</p>
            <p>3. In the unlikely and unprecedented event that you feel like you wasted your time, I will send you $150.00 as a payment immediately. No question asked.  Your time is your most valuable asset you have, and I respect that.</p>
            <p>It really is that simple and there’s no catch.</p>
            <p>Think about this.</p>
            <p>The “worst” that can happen is you get $150 for “wasting” 45-90 minutes of your time.</p>
            <p>The best that can happen is we work together one on one to increase sales and profit several times over.</p>
            
            </div>
            
            <div class="css-container">
            <div class="css-center">
                <h1>That’s Why This Is The Closest Thing To FREE MONEY You’ll Ever See.</h1>
                </div>
                <p>Here’s how it’ll work:</p>
                <p>First, we get on the phone or Zoom and go over your business.</p>
                <p>(Keep in mind, I’m deaf and I use sign language interpreter to communicate with you at no cost to you)</p>
                <p>I take a look at what you’ve got, what you’re doing, and what you want to achieve going forward.</p>
                <p>Once we have those “raw materials”, I help you come up with a strategic plan of action to immediately increase your profits dramatically.</p>
                <p>There are a number of ways I might do this for you.</p>
                <p>For example, I might show you to restructure your offer for a better price point, how to create recurring revenue (even without a continuity program), how to pull in buyers from untapped sources, or how to reactivate past customers.</p>
                <p>And if you have a list of prospects, we’re bound to whip up a quick email promotion you can run within days … and have the cash register ringing over and over again.</p>
                <p>And like I said, there’s no charge for this.</p>
            
                                  </div>
          
            <div class="css-container">
                <div class="css-center"><h2>So Why Would I Offer It? </h2></div>
                
                <p>Two reasons:</p>
                <p>First of all, I enjoy it. This type of thing is what I do best, and it makes me very, very happy to see someone achieve financial success (and all that comes with it) as a result of the help I give them.</p>
                <p>Second of all, it’s how I attract top-level clients.</p>
                <p>Here’s how that works:</p>
                <p>Assuming you’re happy and you want me to crank out these types of plans for you all the time, you’ll probably want to continue working together long term so I can help you implement them.</p>
                <p>If this is the case, I might invite you to become a consulting client.</p>
                <p>My “fee” is $1,750 a month … but if you think about it, it really doesn’t “cost” you anything.</p>
                <p>Why?</p>
                <p>Because I expect to make you much more than $9,750 in the first month … and if we keep working together over the next 12 months, I’m confident I can double your entire business … at minimum.</p>
                <p>Actually, I can give you a plan to make more than $4,860 during our first conversation - which is free!</p>
                <p>So you’ll see the value by the time we hang up the phone - without ever spending a dime.</p>
                <p>And look. If you don’t want to become a client, don’t worry about it. You won’t get any sales pitch or pressure from me of any kind, ever.</p>
                <p>
                    
            </div>
            
            <div class="css-container">
                <div class="css-center"><h2>In fact, here’s my “GIANT BALLS PROMISE” to you:</h2></div>
            
                <p>You Find Our Conversation To Be Incredibly Valuable Or I’ll Pay You $150.00 Immediately To Compensate You For Your Time.</p>
                <p>Now, obviously this is an amazing offer which you’ll probably never see from any other “Internet guru” in the world</p>
                <p>Think about it.</p>
                <p>I’m personally generating a profit-plan for you up front - for free - and then letting you pay me later if (and only if) you decide to work together long term.</p>
                <p>Plus, I’m taking it one BOLD step further by guaranteeing you’ll find this free plan immensely valuable - or I’ll pay you $150 just for wasting your time.</p>
                <p>Just tell me, and it’s yours. No questions asked.</p>
                <p>Who Else Would Do That?</p>
                <p>NOBODY. (I checked)</p>
                <p>But I’m happy to put it on the line like this because my email consulting clients always get great results.</p>
                <p>Period.</p>
                <p>My stuff works, and I know that if we work together, you’ll make money.</p>
                <p>Consider this:</p>
                <p>Over the past six years, I’ve generated over 47 MILLION DOLLARS in sales for myself and my private clients.</p>
                <p>This is why I’m sought out by celebrity entrepreneurs like Tony Robbins, best selling authoers like Neil Strauss, television personalities like Dean Graziosi and just about every “business guru” you can name.</p>
                <p>Anyway - as you can imagine, I’ll get a LOT of interest from this letter.</p>
                <p>And that’s why I need you to read this next part carefully:</p>
                
            </div>
            <div class="css-container">
            <div class="css-center"><h2>This is NOT For Everybody. <br> Here’s Who I CAN Help:</h2></div>
           
                <p>Being Deaf force me to be VERY picky about who I’ll speak with and I’ve got a strict (but reasonable) set of criteria that needs to be met in order for us to proceed.</p>
                <p>Here it is:</p>
                <p>You have to have a solid business already.</p>
                <p>This offer is for people who are up and running already and simply want to run a lot faster and a lot farther.</p>
                <p>You should be doing around six figures or more each year already.</p>
                <p>Oh, and I won’t work with beginners, get rich quick people, or generally hyped loud folks.</p>
                <p>No shenanigans</p>
                <p>2. You must have a steady flow of leads and customers.</p>
                <p>This means that you’re getting consistent traffic and making sales already.</p>
                <p>You’re running ads, you’re promoting, and you’re selling stuff.</p>
                <p>You don’t have to be “everywhere” or “huge” … I just need you to be PRESENT with your both feet stomping in your market.</p>
                <p>3. You must have a list.</p>
                <p>It doesn’t really need to be that big … just responsive.
                <br>(Finally! Size actually doesn’t matter!)</p>
                <p>4. You must have a good, solid product (or service) and a good reputation.</p>
                <p>Everything we do together will not only be bringing you more sales and profits, but we’ll be doing it in a way that creates MASSIVE values in your markets</p>
                <p>And in order for us to do that, you need to already have your act together.</p>
                <p>In other words, you need to be legit.</p>
                <p>5. You MUST follow directions. (Don’t worry, I won’t ask you to do anything weird.)</p>
                <p>After all, if you don’t actually implement the stuff I give you, neither one of us will make money.</p>
                <p>That’s it!  Those are all my requirements.</p>
                <p>Here’s what I want you to do next</p>
                <p>If you meet the criteria above and would like to talk to me personally about getting you incredible results, then I’ll happily set aside some time for you.</p>
                <p>Here’s how the process works:</p>
                <p>First, you’ll need to fill in an application. Don’t worry, it’s simple and unobtrusive.</p>
                <p>I just need to know what you’re selling, get an idea of what you want to accomplish and so forth.</p>
                <p>I’m also going to ask for a “real person” deposit” of $150.</p>
                <p>Don’t worry, I could care less about your $150.</p>
                <p>I’m just using it as a “filter” to keep the time-vampires at bay.</p>
                <p>I’ll give it back right after we hang up (unless I take you as a client - and in that case, I can apply it toward your balance.)</p>
            </div>
                    
            <div class="css-container">
                <div class="css-center"><h2>Here What You Can Expect Happen After That.</h2></div>
                <p>Once I have your “real person” deposit and your application, Jeryl from my office will call you and set up a time for us to talk.</p>
                <p>She’s been my “right hand” for 10 years, is my ONLY employee, and she’ll be contacting you in about 48 business hours at the most.</p>
                <p>Our initial call will be between 45 and 90 mintues.</p>
                <p>This is where we really begin working to figure out exactly what you want … and how to make it happen.</p>
                <p>I’ll painstakingly review your goals, your offers, and so forth … and I’ll deliver a plan to bring in money immediately.</p>
                <p>If you see the value in becoming high level client, great! We can talk about it.</p>
                <p>And if you don’t want to become a client - that’s OK too. I’ll return your deposit as soon as we hang up. No biggie</p>
                <p>And if you tell me I’ve wasted your time, I’ll give you DOUBLE your deposit back immediately.</p>
                <p>So you literally can’t lose.</p>
                <p>(By the way - I’ve never had anyone feel like their time was wasted. EVER. That’s why I can make this offer. I DELIVER.  Would anyone else take such a risk?)</p>            
            </div>
            
            <div class="css-container">
                <div class="css-center"><h2>WARNING - TIME IS A FACTOR</h2></div>    
                <p>This opportunity is extremely limited because of the intense one-on-one time needed in order to provide you with results.</p>
                <p>Therefore, it is physically impossible for me to work with more than a handful of people.</p>
                <p>Also, you should realize there’s a very large demand for personal one-on-one help from me, and what I’m offering to you is unprecedented.</p>
                <p>So with that being said, know that the window of opportunity won’t be open long.</p>
                <p>If you feel like this is right for you, click here, leave your application and let’s talk</p>
                <p>Talk soon,</p>
